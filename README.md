#### Features
##### PWA  - Progressive Web Applications
Using ReactPWA you can create Progressive web application with simple knowledge of React.JS. As we all know, Progressive Apps are not supported everywhere, but we have added support for Safari & Chrome so your application can work as 
standalone applications when added to homescreen or saved as desktop app.  


##### Code splitting
The very difficulty faced when developing enterprise application is code splitting. We don't need everything in a single JS file. Why not create individual JS files for each respective module/page!
We make it really easy here to just create a page that returns an array of routes. Code is split and loaded automatically when the respective route is called.  


##### ES6/7 Compatible
Using babel, we support next generation JavaScript syntax including Object/Array destructuring, arrow functions, JSX syntax and more... 

##### Jest for Unit Testing
Using Jest, we support simple and smooth JavaScript testing, components, async testing, integration testing and more...

##### Universal Routing with React-Router
We are using the most accepted React router for routing the application. Add your favorite /about, /contact, /dashboard pages.  


##### Offline support
Yes your application is offline available. Run without internet. Pretty cool huh?? Well all thanks to service workers.  


##### SSR - Server side rendering
The best way to get your application SEO-ed is enable Server side rendering i.e. Universal applications.  

##### Docker Containerized
